# Engineered synthetic one-carbon fixation exceeds yield of the Calvin Cycle

This repository contains the Data, Code and Results indicated in the publication 'Engineered synthetic one-carbon fixation exceeds yield of the Calvin Cycle' (Beau et al. 2025). 

In this publication, we compare the biomass yield reached in the assimilation of formate via the CBB compared to the assimilation of formate via the rGlyP in _Italic Cupiavidus necator_. 

The repository includes the Genome-scale metabolic model of _Italic C. necator_,  RehMBEL1391_sbml_L3V1, adapted from Jahn et al.<sup>1</sup>; the code to calculate the biomass yield and fluxes at each condition, and the corresponding results.



Note: More information on their finetuned GAM parameter can be found between lines 101 and 104 of the script called ‘run_simulations.py’ within the reported Gitlab repository (https://github.com/m-jahn/genome-scale-models/blob/master/Ralstonia_eutropha/).
